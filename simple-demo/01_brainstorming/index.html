### Week 1: Brainstorming 

#### Monday - 9/12: Solar Tracking Subteam
For the first part of this week, Xavier and I formed a solar tracking subteam, to focus on continuing 
the efforts and iterating on the design of the solar tracking work done by students from the 
previous semester. I was interested in this solar tracking team in particular because I am fascinated by the 
electronics component of this along wit the usage of sensors and actuators as this aligns well with 
my interest in EECS. I see it as an oppurtunity to continue the explorations from 6.08 last year
to build a more large scale and complete project. I want to also look at how the computational, 
electrical, and mechnanical components of this system interact.

To wrap our minds around what this part of the project entailed, we drew a block diagram of our 
subproject and all it's components:
