### Week 1: Brainstorming 

#### Monday - 9/12: Solar Tracking Subteam
For the first part of this week, Xavier and I formed a solar tracking subteam, to focus on continuing 
the efforts and iterating on the design of the solar tracking work done by students from the 
previous semester. I was interested in this solar tracking team in particular because I am fascinated by the 
electronics component of this along wit the usage of sensors and actuators as this aligns well with 
my interest in EECS. I see it as an oppurtunity to continue the explorations from 6.08 last year
to build a more large scale and complete project. I want to also look at how the computational, 
electrical, and mechnanical components of this system interact.

To wrap our minds around what this part of the project entailed, we drew a block diagram of our 
subproject and all it's components:

We learned about the two types of control systems: open loop and closed loop sensing as they are 
used in general to accomplish engineering instructions. For our project, the engineering instruction 
we seek to accomplish is rotating the position of the solar cooker using motors such that the 
cooker is angled optimally for maximum sunlight.

Our initial conclusion given that we have no data on the energy cost of operating our motors is to
go with a balanced approach of using some prexisting data based on time of day, latitutde, and longitude 
to set an initial position of the solar cooker, and then using sensor data to 
make micro-adjustments from there. At a certain experimentally determined sampling interval, we make
a new measurement of using the photoresistor circuit to adjust to a new position. 

#### Wednesday - 9/14: Testing Commercial Solar Cookers
For this second part of the week, we worked from Building 31 to test commercial solar cookers. we
had a total of 3 different solar cookers of different scale, technologies, and price points. 
Initially, Brittany, Xavier, and I worked on assembling the largest solar cooker and we were pretty
close to fully assembling the solar cooker but it wasn't quite ready for testing on Wednesday.

At around 4:30 in the afternoon, we headed out and positioned our two other solar cookers outside -- 
the cyclindrical and the cardboard cooker. As time progressed, we plotted the temperature of roughly
equal volumes of water heated in each cooker, measured using a thermocouple. The two cookers both
started with water temperatures at around 23 degrees celsius but at the end, both had heated up the
water up to above 30 degrees celsius. We also used a Flir camera to take thermal images and measure 
the surface temperature and the temperature distribution of both cookers.

#### Planned Next Steps:
1. Design and Run Experimental Set up with all 3 solar cookers.

2. Set up Arduino Uno software and understand the current code and circuit design

Improvements from experiments:
- Standardize the volume of water in each solar cooker
- Find a stable setting to ensure equal and consistent sunlight for all cookers
