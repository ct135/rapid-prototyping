### Week 2: Desingning a Reflector 

#### Monday - 9/19: CAD and CNC Introduction
Today, Justin introduced the concept of Computer Automated Design (CAD) and Computer Automated Manufacturing (CAM)
of which, Computer Numeric Control (CNC) is one type. The CAD software we are using is Fusion 360 by Autodesk. We learned
about the various capabilities of the software more specifically, the CAD and tool path editor that we
would likely be using. In addition, we discussed the potential design for the reflector that was worked on in previous years. 
At the core of the design for the reflector was a desire for it to concentrate light towards the focal point so we initially chose to use a 
parabola with its focal point set as the position for where we would concentrate the sunlight. 


### Wednesday - 9/21: CAD and CNC Continuation
We spent the day split between two groups, experimentation with the commercial solar cooker as well as continuing to learn more about Fusion 360.
I spent most of my time learning about the Fusion 360 software and we focsed on learning about the various way to design tool paths in Fusion 360. Here
is a brief summary of some of the notes I took:

- We have few options when it comes to design choices for the toolpath:
    - spindle speed which is chosen based on the material + diameter of end mill
    - the linear rate of the tool edge which is determined by spindle speed 
    - the linear feed rate,  or how fast the carriage/table moves

- A few parts of the toolpath to consider are lean in/lean outs which means basically how the tool starts on the side of the block and slides
in tangentially to the place it wants to cut rather than with a directly vertical approach which is more destructive

- We also learned about the different types of toolpaths like roughing which is useful for removing an entire layer of material and the scallop toolpath.

One important lesson we discussed is the trade off spending a lot of time designing a very elegant or efficient toolpath that saves machining time
just spending less design time and more machining time. For a design at our level for we are unlikely to resuse and remake the product multiple times, we 
arrived at the consensus that it may be beneficial to just aim for an acceptable toolpath.


### Goals for Next Week:
1. I want to spend time setting up the Arduino circuit and running some of the code and understanding how the past code works
2. I want to continue learning how to use the Fusion software, being able to CAD a basic reflector design
