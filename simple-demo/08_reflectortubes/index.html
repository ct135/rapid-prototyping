### Week 8: Solar Tracker and Conical Focusers

### Monday - 10/31: Completed Solar Tracker Prototype
At the start of the class, we immiediately began testing the solar tracker. Running the algorithm, we found 
that the solar tracker worked very well. A few things we noted was that we could adjust the differential threshold threshold
to change the sensitivity of the tracker. There was also another way in which we could adjust the threshold using physical properties.
If we were to make the walls of the cruciform taller. A smaller shift would result in a great change in the shadow
cast on the photoresistors. These two are important considerations for control in the future on determining performance of the tracker.

While testing the solar tracker outside, we found that the solar tracker got readings of about 800 when placed on a partly cloudy
day outside. This meant that another consideration we discussed was how to ensure that we don't end up having cut-off errors. For example,
if we ended up having too high readings under direct sunlight, we could adjust the resistances of the resistors in the future circuit
or we could add "sunglasses" to block a portion of the sunlight. Towards the end of the class, we began setting up simple circuit just to
measure the amount of light focused through the conical reflector.

### Wednesday - 11/2: Making Conical Reflectors
We made a conical reflector using carboard shaped into a cone, sprayed with an adhesive, and then covered with aluminum foil. With various
cone designs, we also ran some tests of the reflectivity of a few new materials including a plastic gold colored film and both sides of the 
aluminum foil. After the cone was built, we used the small two photoresistor circuit to find the average reading of the light focused
from the cone vs. without the cone. We found that with the cone, there was a slightly higher so this shows promise for using a cone to catch
the focused light off the bounce mirror in the future.
